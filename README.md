# titanic_survival_research
Took a closer look at the disaster with the main goal to create a classification model to predict if the person will be alive on Titanic or not. In this project, I used Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Feature Engineering and finally achieved ~95% accuracy of the model.
